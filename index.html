      <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
      <p>I worked as a full stack developer at RBC, creating tools and applications for enterprises within the company. My position was located in Toronto, Ontario, near the GO station. RBC, as one of Canada's largest financial institutions, provided a unique opportunity to work on a range of applications and tools in a fast-paced environment.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>During my time at RBC, I set several personal and professional goals that I aimed to achieve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand professional coding:</strong> As this was my first software job, I wanted to grasp the difference between academic and professional coding environments. I learned that professional code is much more structured, modular, and subject to rigorous code reviews. I have developed the ability to naturally produce code that meets professional standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Experience coding in a team:</strong> Having never coded in a team environment, I aimed to understand how collaboration works. I learned that teamwork extensively involves using tools like Git, and that team members naturally support and help each other through constant communication and shared goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve presentation skills:</strong> I wanted to enhance my ability to present ideas to colleagues and superiors. My boss provided me with multiple opportunities to present to groups, which helped me significantly improve my public speaking and presentation skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop independent problem-solving skills:</strong> I aimed to become more proactive in generating ideas. I achieved this by going beyond the task at hand to infer the reasoning behind it, which helped me understand requirements more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain a healthy sleep schedule:</strong> Knowing that lack of sleep impacts me significantly, I set a goal to maintain a healthy sleep schedule. I achieved this by creating a strict schedule and a to-do list that I followed diligently.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="job-description">
      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>At RBC, I worked as a full stack developer, primarily using Django and Express.js. One of my key projects was creating a system-wide reporting system that tracked details about my team's task completion status and other task-related statistics. This project involved utilizing various skills in both backend and frontend development, which I learned both in class and on the job.</p>

    <section id="conclusions">
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into professional development, teamwork, and achieving personal goals in a corporate environment. I hope that readers will understand the significance of these lessons and how they contributed to my growth as a software developer.</p>
